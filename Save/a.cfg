["map = 00.rb", ""]

I want to insert some other rows at specific line. Like i want insert "map = 00.rb" on line number 1. "Jay_dead = true" on line number 2. "weapon = stick" on line number 5. And re-edit only for example the stick part on line number 5.

I saw this method:

    def write_at(fname, at_line, sdat)
      open(fname, 'r+') do |f|
        while (at_line-=1) > 0          # read up to the line you want to write after
          f.readline
        end
        pos = f.pos                     # save your position in the file
        rest = f.read                   # save the rest of the file
        f.seek pos                      # go back to the old position
        f.write [sdat, rest]            # write new data & rest of file
      end
    end

But then I got this output in my file:   

["map = 00.rb", ""]

And I cannot edit only the 00.rb part. Can someone help me oud with this?
